<h1>The Best Movies According to Lubna</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>

<p>This movie is a science fiction masterpiece. Apart from the mysteries of the universe, it protrays so many things such as human emotions, love, sacrifice and betrayal.</p>

<h3>Grave of the Fireflies</h3>

<p>The most heart wrenching anime movie I have ever watched. It shows us the darkest sides of the atrocities of war. Although this movie is quite old but it is timeless and a masterpiece anime movie.</p>

<h3>Five Feer Apart</h3>

<p>Sometime circumstances force a person to sacrifice their love for the sake of their loved one. Five Feet Apart teaches us that if we truly love someone we have to let them go. I think it is quite underrated but it is based on real incidents that is what makes it more heart-breaking.</p>
